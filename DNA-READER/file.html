                    <h2>Amino Fact #1:</h2>
                    <p>The average molecular weight of an amino acid is 110Da. Dalton (Da) is an alternate name for the atomic mass unit, and kilodalton (kDa) is 1,000 daltons. Thus a protein with a mass of 64kDa has a molecular weight of 64,000 grams per mole.</p>

                    <h2>Amino Fact #2:</h2>
                    <p>Your body can’t produce the nine essential amino acids, so you need to get them from your diet. Conditionally essential amino acids are nonessential amino acids that become essential in certain circumstances, such as illness or pregnancy.</p>

                    <h2>Amino Fact #3</h2>
                    <p>Many animal and plant foods, such as meat, eggs, quinoa, and soy, contain all nine essential amino acids and are considered complete proteins. Dosing of amino acid supplements depends on the specific amino acid and your reason for using it. If you’re interested in taking essential amino acid supplements, consult a qualified healthcare professional.</p>
